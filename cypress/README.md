# Cypress Testing Guide

This document covers everything you need to know about testing the Cloud Storage Dashboard with Cypress. Our testing strategy focuses on end-to-end scenarios that mirror real user interactions.

## üéØ What We Test

Our Cypress tests cover the critical user journeys that ensure the application works as expected:

- **Buckets Page**: Creating, renaming, and deleting buckets
- **Analytics Page**: Storage analytics, cost breakdown, and usage metrics
- **Billing Page**: Billing overview, payment methods, and invoices

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Node.js v16+ installed
- The main application running (`npm start`)
- Cypress installed (included in dev dependencies)

### First Time Setup

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open Cypress Test Runner**:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

## üß™ Running Tests

### Interactive Mode (Recommended for Development)
```bash
npx cypress open
```
This opens the Cypress Test Runner where you can:
- See tests run in real-time
- Debug failing tests step by step
- View screenshots and videos
- Use browser dev tools

Runs all tests without opening the browser - perfect for automated testing.

### Running Specific Tests
```bash
# Run only buckets tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/buckets.cy.ts"

# Run only analytics tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/analytics.cy.ts"

# Run only billing tests
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/billing.cy.ts"

# Run all tests
npx cypress run
```

## üìÅ Test Structure

### E2E Tests (`cypress/e2e/`)

| File | Purpose | Coverage |
|------|---------|----------|
| `buckets.cy.ts` | Bucket management | CRUD operations, search, navigation |
| `analytics.cy.ts` | Analytics dashboard | Metrics, charts, period selection |
| `billing.cy.ts` | Billing and payments | Invoices, payment methods, cost tracking |

### Support Files (`cypress/support/`)

- `commands.ts` - Custom Cypress commands for common actions
- `e2e.ts` - Global configuration for E2E tests
- `component.ts` - Configuration for component tests

### Test Data (`cypress/fixtures/`)

Mock data files that provide consistent test scenarios:
- `buckets.json` - Sample bucket data for bucket management tests
- `analytics.json` - Analytics test data for metrics and charts
- `billing.json` - Billing information for invoices and payment methods



### Getting Help

1. Check the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)
2. Look at existing tests for examples
3. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Review screenshots and videos in `cypress/screenshots/` and `cypress/videos/`

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Tests failing on CI**: Ensure the development server is running before tests
- **Element not found**: Check if the element has the correct `data-test` attribute
- **Responsive issues**: Verify viewport settings in test configuration
- **MSW not working**: Ensure MSW is properly configured in the application

**Debug Tips:**
- Use `cy.pause()` to pause test execution
- Add `cy.debug()` to inspect elements
- Check network requests in the browser dev tools
- Review the application state in Redux DevTools

## üì± Responsive Testing

The application is fully responsive and tested across different screen sizes:

### Viewport Testing
Tests run on multiple viewport sizes to ensure responsive design works correctly:
- **Mobile**: 375x667 (iPhone SE)
- **Tablet**: 768x1024 (iPad)
- **Desktop**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)

### Responsive Features Tested
- Mobile navigation and sidebar
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Proper text scaling and spacing

## üìä Test Reports

After running tests, you'll find:
- **Screenshots**: `cypress/screenshots/` - Images of failed tests
- **Videos**: `cypress/videos/` - Recordings of test runs
- **Console output**: Detailed logs of test execution
